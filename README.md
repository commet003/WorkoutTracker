# WorkoutTracker
 
A small python app that uses the nutritionix api to allow a user to type in their completed exercies as a normal sentence and send back exercise data in json format, it then uses the Sheety api to take the returned data and add it to a google spreadsheet. 

You can see how it works by going to https://repl.it/@commet003/WorkoutTracker#main.py and running the application.
